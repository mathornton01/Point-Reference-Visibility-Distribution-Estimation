# Point-Reference-Visibility-Distribution-Estimation
A Project that intends to use a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the distribution of a ships visibility.  

For instance, consider the situation where several vessels traveling within the same vicinity of each other, but along 
slightly different path trajectories report their latitude and longitude, as well as the orientation off the 
vessel, and approximate distance to the sighted whale or pod of whales.  Such a data set exists and is well maintained [here](http://optserv1.whoi.edu/jg/otheropt3//globec.whoi.edu:80/globec/soglobec/whale_sightings.html0%7Bdir=globec.whoi.edu/jg/dir/globec/soglobec/,info=globec.whoi.edu/jg/info/globec/soglobec/whale_sightings%7D?)
